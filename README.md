##Angular.js Boiler Plate
######Alpha 0.1.0 - No Angular.js intergration. Working Express.js server with auto reload. 

This is a boiler plate that I am slowly building from scratch. It's intended audiance is someone who wants somemthing light weight - a simple boiler plate containing Angular.js running on express.js with no testers, minifiers, etc.
**Features automatic page refresh(remote and local) on modified files with in /static**

```
Instructions:
1) Install grunt.js with "npm install -g grunt"
2) In the same directory as package.json resides in, type in 'npm install' to install local dependencies.
